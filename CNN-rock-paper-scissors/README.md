# CNN-rock_paper_scissors
Recognizer berween rock paper and scissors using CNN

#Project Description
This project goal is to distinguish between rock paper scissors image using convolutional neural network. We get the data from ['https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanikamal/rock-paper-scissors-dataset']

#How to Install and Run the Project
- open kaggle.com, open yout notebook
- import cv2 and os to get the data from directory of kaggle
- preprocessing the data : because we have different skin color in image, we convert it to YRCRB image and appliying canny thresholding method
- transform the data, train the model and evaluate the performance
- test the model
